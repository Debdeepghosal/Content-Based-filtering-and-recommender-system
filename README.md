# Content-Based-filtering-for-recommender-system

❓ Ever wondered how social media seems to predict your preferences? 
It's not mind-reading; it's the power of a recommender system!

🧠 Content-based filtering a fundamental machine learning algorithm is widely employed in almost all consumer applications, from Netflix suggesting those binge-worthy movies to Instagram, serving up those addictive reels.

🧠 Content-based filtering uses item(movie) features(such as genres, ratings, etc.) to suggest other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions (such as ratings).

🚀 This project is on Content-Based Filtering for movie recommendations. The dataset is from MovieLens comprising 9000 movies,600 users, and around 100k ratings. 

🚀 The model implemented comprises two neural networks for users and movies respectively, which calculates their inherent features and predicts the ratings. Which can further be used for recommendation.
